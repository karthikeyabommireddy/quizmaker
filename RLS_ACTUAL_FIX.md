# üéØ ACTUAL ROOT CAUSE FOUND!

## The Problem
`auth.uid()` returns **NULL** during signup because:
- Supabase requires **email confirmation** by default
- Until the user confirms their email, they don't have an active session
- Without a session, `auth.uid()` returns NULL
- RLS policies that check `auth.uid()` fail

---

## ‚úÖ SOLUTION (Choose ONE)

### **Option 1: Disable Email Confirmation (Quick Fix - Recommended for Development)**

This is the fastest fix for development/testing:

#### Step 1: Go to Supabase Auth Settings
https://supabase.com/dashboard/project/oxiglgetwzjquzaibsyz/auth/users

#### Step 2: Click "Configuration" ‚Üí "Email Auth"

#### Step 3: Toggle OFF "Enable email confirmations"

#### Step 4: Save changes

#### Step 5: Try signing up again

**Why this works:** 
- When email confirmation is disabled, users get an active session immediately after signup
- `auth.uid()` will return the user ID
- RLS policies will work

---

### **Option 2: Use Database Trigger (Best Practice - Recommended for Production)**

This automatically creates the profile when a user is created, bypassing RLS entirely:

#### Step 1: Run this SQL in Supabase SQL Editor

```sql
-- Create a function that creates a user profile automatically
CREATE OR REPLACE FUNCTION public.handle_new_user()
RETURNS TRIGGER AS $$
BEGIN
  INSERT INTO public.users_profile (user_id, full_name, role)
  VALUES (
    NEW.id,
    COALESCE(NEW.raw_user_meta_data->>'full_name', 'User'),
    COALESCE(NEW.raw_user_meta_data->>'role', 'student')
  );
  RETURN NEW;
END;
$$ LANGUAGE plpgsql SECURITY DEFINER;

-- Create a trigger that runs after a user is created
DROP TRIGGER IF EXISTS on_auth_user_created ON auth.users;
CREATE TRIGGER on_auth_user_created
  AFTER INSERT ON auth.users
  FOR EACH ROW
  EXECUTE FUNCTION public.handle_new_user();
```

#### Step 2: Update the signup code to pass metadata

I'll update the AuthContext.tsx file to pass user data as metadata.

**Why this works:**
- Profile is created by a SECURITY DEFINER function (bypasses RLS)
- Happens automatically when user is created
- Works even without email confirmation
- Production-ready pattern

---

### **Option 3: Sign In After Sign Up (Alternative)**

Modify the signup flow to sign in immediately after creating the user.

---

## üöÄ My Recommendation

**For now (Development):** Use **Option 1** - Disable email confirmation. It's instant and you can test immediately.

**For later (Production):** Use **Option 2** - Database trigger. It's the proper way and works with email confirmation enabled.

---

## üìù Which Option Do You Want?

Reply with:
- **"option 1"** - I'll help you disable email confirmation
- **"option 2"** - I'll implement the database trigger and update the code
- **"both"** - I'll implement the trigger for production, and you disable email confirmation for testing now

Let me know!
