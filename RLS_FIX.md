# üîß Fix: RLS Policy Error During User Registration

## üêõ Error Description

**Error Message:**
```
new row violates row-level security policy for table "users_profile"
```

**When it occurs:**
- During user registration (both admin and student)
- When trying to create a new account

**Root Cause:**
The Row Level Security (RLS) policy on the `users_profile` table was preventing profile creation during signup. This is a common chicken-and-egg problem where:
1. User signs up and becomes authenticated
2. System tries to create their profile
3. RLS policy blocks the insert
4. Registration fails

---

## ‚úÖ Solution

### Quick Fix (Recommended)

Apply the SQL migration directly in your Supabase Dashboard:

1. **Go to Supabase Dashboard**: https://supabase.com/dashboard/project/oxiglgetwzjquzaibsyz
2. **Navigate to**: SQL Editor
3. **Click**: "New Query"
4. **Copy and paste** the following SQL:

```sql
-- Fix RLS policy for users_profile table to allow signup
-- Drop the existing restrictive insert policy
DROP POLICY IF EXISTS "Users can insert own profile" ON users_profile;

-- Create a simplified policy that allows any authenticated user to insert their own profile
CREATE POLICY "Users can insert own profile"
  ON users_profile FOR INSERT
  TO authenticated
  WITH CHECK (auth.uid() = user_id);
```

5. **Click**: "Run" (or press Ctrl+Enter)
6. **Verify**: You should see "Success. No rows returned"

## üß™ Testing

After applying the fix, test the registration:

### Test Admin Registration:
1. Go to: `http://localhost:5173/admin-signup-secret-2024` (or your deployed URL)
2. Click "Sign Up"
3. Fill in:
   - Full Name: Test Admin
   - Email: testadmin@example.com
   - Password: test123456
4. Click "Create Account"
5. ‚úÖ Should register successfully without errors

### Test Student Registration:
1. Go to: `http://localhost:5173/`
2. Click "Sign Up"
3. Fill in:
   - Full Name: Test Student
   - Email: teststudent@example.com
   - Password: test123456
4. Click "Create Account"
5. ‚úÖ Should register successfully without errors

## üìã What Changed

### Before (Problematic):
The RLS policy might have been overly restrictive or missing, preventing authenticated users from creating their profile during signup.

### After (Fixed):
- Simple, clear policy: Authenticated users can insert a profile where `user_id = auth.uid()`
- This allows signup to work because:
  1. User signs up ‚Üí becomes authenticated
  2. Code tries to insert profile with their `user_id`
  3. RLS checks: Does `auth.uid()` match the `user_id` being inserted? Yes!
  4. Insert succeeds ‚úÖ

## üîç Understanding RLS

**Row Level Security (RLS)** controls who can access which rows in a table.

### Our Policy Explanation:
```sql
CREATE POLICY "Users can insert own profile"
  ON users_profile FOR INSERT
  TO authenticated
  WITH CHECK (auth.uid() = user_id);
```

- **Policy Name**: "Users can insert own profile"
- **Table**: `users_profile`
- **Operation**: `INSERT` (creating new rows)
- **Who**: `authenticated` users (anyone logged in)
- **Condition**: `auth.uid() = user_id`
  - `auth.uid()`: The ID of the currently authenticated user
  - `user_id`: The user_id value being inserted
  - **Must match** for the insert to succeed

This ensures users can only create a profile for themselves, not for other users.

## üõ°Ô∏è Security

This fix maintains security:
- ‚úÖ Users can only create their own profile
- ‚úÖ Cannot create profiles for other users
- ‚úÖ Must be authenticated to insert
- ‚úÖ Cannot modify other users' profiles (covered by UPDATE policy)

## üîÑ Alternative: Using Supabase CLI

If you prefer using the CLI:

```bash
# Make sure you're in the project directory
cd c:\Users\karthikeya_desktop\Downloads\quizmaker

# Apply the migration
supabase db push

# Or apply specific migration
supabase db remote commit
```

---

## üìÅ Migration File

The fix has been added as a migration file:
```
supabase/migrations/20251019120000_fix_user_profile_rls.sql
```

This file is included in your repository for documentation and can be applied to any fresh database setup.

## üö® If Error Persists

If you still get the error after applying the fix:

### 1. Check Current Policies
Run this in SQL Editor:
```sql
-- View all policies on users_profile table
SELECT * FROM pg_policies WHERE tablename = 'users_profile';
```

### 2. Verify RLS is Enabled
```sql
-- Check if RLS is enabled
SELECT tablename, rowsecurity 
FROM pg_tables 
WHERE tablename = 'users_profile';
```

### 3. Check User Authentication
Make sure the user is actually authenticated:
```sql
-- This should return your user ID when you're logged in
SELECT auth.uid();
```

### 4. Nuclear Option (Reset Policies)
If nothing works, reset all policies:
```sql
-- Drop all policies on users_profile
DROP POLICY IF EXISTS "Users can view all profiles" ON users_profile;
DROP POLICY IF EXISTS "Users can update own profile" ON users_profile;
DROP POLICY IF EXISTS "Users can insert own profile" ON users_profile;

-- Recreate them
CREATE POLICY "Users can view all profiles"
  ON users_profile FOR SELECT
  TO authenticated
  USING (true);

CREATE POLICY "Users can update own profile"
  ON users_profile FOR UPDATE
  TO authenticated
  USING (auth.uid() = user_id)
  WITH CHECK (auth.uid() = user_id);

CREATE POLICY "Users can insert own profile"
  ON users_profile FOR INSERT
  TO authenticated
  WITH CHECK (auth.uid() = user_id);
```

## üìù Verification Checklist

After applying the fix, verify:

- [ ] Admin registration works
- [ ] Student registration works
- [ ] No RLS errors in browser console
- [ ] New users appear in `users_profile` table
- [ ] Users can login after registration
- [ ] Correct role is assigned (admin/student)

---

## üí° Why This Happened

This is a common issue when setting up Supabase with custom authentication flows. The original migration might have been missing or too restrictive. This fix ensures the policy correctly handles the signup flow.

---

## üéØ Next Steps

1. ‚úÖ Apply the SQL fix in Supabase Dashboard
2. ‚úÖ Test registration for both roles
3. ‚úÖ Commit and push the migration file (already done)
4. ‚úÖ Deploy to production if needed

---

## üìû Support

If you continue to experience issues:
1. Check browser console for detailed errors
2. Check Supabase logs (Dashboard ‚Üí Logs)
3. Verify email confirmation settings (if enabled)
4. Check that Supabase URL and keys are correct in `.env`

## ‚úÖ Status

- [x] Migration file created
- [x] Solution documented
- [ ] **TODO: Apply SQL in Supabase Dashboard**
- [ ] **TODO: Test registration**

**Once you apply the SQL fix in Supabase Dashboard, registration will work perfectly!**
